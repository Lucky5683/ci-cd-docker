# Project1 - CI/CD Pipeline with Docker and Kubernetes

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys a Node.js application using:

- **Docker** for containerization  
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation  
- **Kubernetes (Minikube)** for deployment  

---

## Features

- Automated Docker image build and push to Docker Hub  
- Automated testing in GitHub Actions workflow  
- Kubernetes deployment and service manifests included  
- Easy to deploy on local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube) or any K8s cluster  

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running  
- Minikube installed and running (for local Kubernetes cluster)  
- kubectl CLI installed  
- GitHub account with secrets configured for Docker Hub credentials (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`)  

---

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/project1.git
cd project1
````

### Build and run locally (optional)

```bash
docker build -t lucky5683/project1:latest .
docker run -p 3000:3000 lucky5683/project1:latest
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow

* On every push to `main` branch:

  * The workflow checks out the code
  * Builds the Docker image
  * Pushes the image to Docker Hub
  * Runs tests before pushing

---

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Deploy the app

Make sure Minikube is running:

```bash
minikube start
```

Apply Kubernetes manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f service.yml
```

### Verify deployment

Check pods and services:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
```

### Access the app

For Minikube, run:

```bash
minikube service <service-name>
```

Replace `<service-name>` with the name defined in your `service.yml` file.
